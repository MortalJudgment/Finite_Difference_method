# Finite Difference method (2019-2020)
## Introduction
Welcome to the Finite Difference Method (FDM) project for MATLAB! This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for getting started, details about its usage, features, and how to contribute.
## Project Overview
The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). It is designed for engineers, scientists, and researchers looking to solve PDEs numerically using MATLAB.
This project focuses on implementing FDM solvers for three important types of equations:

1. Advection Equation: Describes the transport of a quantity by a velocity field.
2. Diffusion Equation: Models the spread of a quantity through diffusion or heat conduction.
3. Poisson Nernst Planck Equation: A combination of the Poisson equation and the Nernst-Planck equation, often used to describe ion transport in electrochemical systems.

This project aims to provide MATLAB-based FDM solvers for these equations, making it accessible for researchers and engineers in various fields, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and electrochemistry.
